# Usage
You can deploy Wazuh as a single-node or multi-node stack.

* Single-node deployment: Deploys one Wazuh manager, indexer, and dashboard node.
* Multi-node deployment: Deploys two Wazuh manager nodes (one master and one worker), three Wazuh indexer nodes, and a Wazuh dashboard node.

Both deployments use persistence and allow configuring certificates to secure communications between nodes. The multi-node stack is the only deployment that contains high availability.
