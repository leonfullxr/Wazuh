# SOC Wazuh Lab

A lightweight Security Operations Center lab using Docker, Wazuh, Nginx (reverse-proxy & load-balancer) and two Apache web servers.


## üöÄ Architecture

- **Nginx**: reverse proxy & least-connections load balancing  
- **2√ó Apache**: backend web servers (you can swap these for DVWA, etc.)  
- **Wazuh Agents**: running inside each container + the host

All containers communicate over a custom Docker bridge network (`webnet`).

## üìÇ File summary

File | Purpose
docker-compose.yml | Defines services, volumes, network (webnet).
apache/Dockerfile | Builds Apache containers from httpd:2.4.
apache/html/index.html | Sample home page (swap in DVWA or your app).
nginx/Dockerfile | Builds Nginx from nginx:latest.
nginx/nginx.conf | Reverse-proxy + security headers + load-balancing.
nginx/ssl/nginx-*.{crt,key} | Self-signed cert used by Nginx HTTPS server.

## üîß Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose v1.27+  
- OpenSSL (for cert generation)  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Steps

1.Clone this repo  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/youruser/soc-wazuh-lab.git
cd soc-wazuh-lab
```

2.Create the Docker network

```bash
docker network create webnet
```

3.(Re)generate a self-signed SSL certificate

```bash
mkdir -p nginx/ssl
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 \
  -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout nginx/ssl/nginx-selfsigned.key \
  -out nginx/ssl/nginx-selfsigned.crt \
  -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Org/OU=Unit/CN=localhost"
```

4.Build & launch

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Verify the following:

```bash
docker ps shows three containers: apache1, apache2, nginx.
```

* Tail Wazuh logs: ```bash tail -f /var/ossec/logs/ossec.log ```

* Hit http://localhost or https://localhost and watch requests land on both backends.

* Container security in Wazuh:

With this structure in place, you can:

1. Customize the sample index.html or swap in DVWA under apache/html/.

2. Drop your Wazuh Manager into the same network (or run it on the host) and point each agent to it.

3. Extend with container‚Äêsecurity rules via Wazuh‚Äôs Docker integration docs linked in the README.
