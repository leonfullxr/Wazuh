## Repository structure

I will expand this repository in the near future, but for now, I will have the following directories:
- containerization --> Here I will have everything related to containerization, such as Docker and Kubernetes configurations.
    - Docker --> Here I will have single-node and multi-node Docker configurations, with HTTP and reverse proxy configurations (Traefik), and so on.
- scripts --> Here I will have a few scripts, such as RestfulAPI connections, 
- rules --> Here I will have custom wazuh rule configurations, mostly for FortiGate routers, for now.
- decoders --> Here I will have custom wazuh decoder configurations, mostly for FortiGate routers, for now.
- integrations --> Here I will have custom wazuh integration configurations, such as LDAPS, custom API connections, custom alerts integration, LLM integration, etc.
